# Amazon-Price-Tracker
This project is a price tracking tool that uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to monitor product prices on e-commerce websites like Amazon. When the price of a specified item falls below a user-defined threshold, the program automatically sends an alert email using the smtplib module.
